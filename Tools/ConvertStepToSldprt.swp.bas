'  ConvertStepToSldprt  -  batch STEP -> SolidWorks converter
'  For the VEX CAD library.  Tested against the folder layout produced by
'  the 2026 catalog refresh.
'
'  WHAT IT DOES
'    Walks every .step / .stp file under SRC_ROOT, opens it in SolidWorks,
'    and saves it as .SLDPRT (or .SLDASM if SolidWorks decides the file is
'    an assembly) into OUT_ROOT, mirroring the folder structure.
'
'  IT IS RESUMABLE.  Files that already have an up-to-date output are
'  skipped, so you can stop it (Esc) and re-run it later without redoing
'  work.  Progress is written to OUT_ROOT\_conversion-log.txt.
'
'  HOW TO RUN
'    1. Open SolidWorks.
'    2. Set the STEP import options first - see Tools\README-CONVERSION.md.
'       This matters a lot for speed; skipping it can make the run 10x slower.
'    3. Tools > Macro > New...  save as ConvertStepToSldprt.swp
'    4. Paste this file's contents in, replacing whatever is there.
'    5. Press F5.
'
'  Expect this to take a while.  A few of the electronics STEP files are
'  15+ MB and can take several minutes each on their own.
