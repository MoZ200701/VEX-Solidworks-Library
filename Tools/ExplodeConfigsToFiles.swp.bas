' ===========================================================================
'  ExplodeConfigsToFiles  -  one .SLDPRT per configuration
'  For the VEX CAD library.
'
'  WHAT IT DOES
'    The v1.1.1 library ships each cut-to-length metal as ONE part with one
'    configuration per hole count - C-Channel carries "1" through "35",
'    driven by a design table. This writes a standalone, single-configuration
'    file for every one of them, beside the master in a folder of its own:
'
'      Structure\C-Channel\Aluminum 2 Wide C-Channel.SLDPRT   <- master, untouched
'      Structure\C-Channel\Aluminum 2 Wide C-Channel\
'          1 Aluminum 2 Wide C-Channel.SLDPRT
'          2 Aluminum 2 Wide C-Channel.SLDPRT
'          ... 35 Aluminum 2 Wide C-Channel.SLDPRT
'
'    The "<holes> <master name>.SLDPRT" naming is the one v1.1.1 already used
'    for the single file it shipped this way, "25 Aluminum 2 Wide C-Channel".
'
'  HOW IT WORKS, AND WHY
'    SolidWorks has no "save this configuration as its own part" API, and a
'    plain Save As copies ALL 35 configurations into every output file. So
'    for each configuration the macro copies the master to the output name,
'    opens the copy, activates the wanted configuration, deletes the design
'    table, deletes every other configuration, rebuilds and saves.
'
'    The design table has to go first: it owns those configurations, so with
'    it still in place the deletions either fail or come back on the next
'    edit. Only the copy is touched - the master keeps its table and all 35.
'
'  IT IS RESUMABLE.  An output at least as new as its master is skipped, so
'  you can stop it (Esc) and re-run without redoing work. Delete an output
'  folder to force those files to be rebuilt.
'
'  HOW TO RUN
'    1. Open SolidWorks.
'    2. Tools > Macro > New...  save as ExplodeConfigsToFiles.swp
'    3. Paste this file's contents in, replacing whatever is there.
'    4. Edit LIB_ROOT and TargetFolders below if you want more than C-Channel.
'    5. Press F5.
'
'  Budget about 5 seconds per file. C-Channel alone is 5 masters x 35 = 175
'  files, roughly 15 minutes and about 700 MB on disk.

'
'   Structure\U-Channel      20 configurations, 1-20. Not 35.
'   Structure\Chassis Rail   25, 25 and 35, depending on the part.
'   Structure\Linear Slide   35 configurations.
'
'   Structure\Plate          124 configurations each, and the 0.25in Pitch
'   Structure\0.25in Pitch Structure   Plate has 300. These are named
'       "5x25" - width x length in holes - not a plain hole count, so they
'       need MAX_HOLES = 0 or WantConfig below skips every one of them.
'       The 0.25in pitch parts are also on a 0.25in hole pitch, not 0.5in,
'       so their configuration N is N x 0.25in long.
